Just look for a webarchive of the website of KCSTC. I believe [MetaWiki](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Kalpana_Chawla_Space_Technology_Cell) links to an archived version as well

[KCSTC Archive](https://webcf.waybackmachine.org/web/20220811070413/http://www.kcstc.iitkgp.ernet.in/eminent_guests.html)

From here you can see the eminent guest was "G. Madhavan Nair" who visited us in November, 2004. From [his wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Madhavan_Nair) he was born in present day Tamil Nadu. 

In the description I did mention not to brute force the flag, however I can't remember if I actually implemented an attempt limit. I hope I did, if not then welp.
