Description: 
> I took a metro from this location and I saw a shopping complex in the vicinity. I remembered that I saw a multidimensional billboard from a company over there. The same company held a concert on 26th October 2024, and a group performed there. However, I have forgotten what the information really was. Can you help me?

This challenge was taken from [niteCTF 2024](https://github.com/Cryptonite-MIT/niteCTF-2024/tree/main). This was another absolutely fantastic CTF and I recommend everyone go through the writeups they've meticulously prepared.

I'll link to their official writeup for this challenge, we don't have one because we couldn't solve this challenge when we were attempting this CTF.
