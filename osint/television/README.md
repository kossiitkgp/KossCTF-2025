This challenge was taken from [USC CTF Fall 2024](https://github.com/USC-CTF-Team/public-USC-CTF-Fall-24/tree/main). This was a fantastic CTF for beginners and I highly recommend everyone have a look at the writeups. 

For this challenge you can look at 
- [The Official Writeup](https://github.com/USC-CTF-Team/public-USC-CTF-Fall-24/tree/main/osint/television)
- [My Writeup](https://github.com/Majestic9169/USC-CTF-Fall-2024/tree/main/osint/osint_television)

Many thanks to the team over at USC, and I'm sorry I used their challenge without their permission.
