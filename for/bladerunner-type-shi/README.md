The hint was in the title. "Type". This is also directly given in the slides.

Basically `bladerunner.exe` is not an `.exe` it's an image with the wrong file extension.

Simply rename the file to `bladerunner.png` and open it with any image viewer.

Bonus points to anyone who got the K-On reference.
